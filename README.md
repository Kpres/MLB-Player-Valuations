Analysis of Major League Baseball Player value through salary compensation

This project analyzes the most undervalued and overvalued MLB players by using metrics to determine the true value of a player when compared to their salary.

# Theory
In Major League Baseball, statsitics like runs batted in, batting average, and stolen bases are the most common metrics used to determine the overall value of a player and the significance the player will be to a team. Given these statistics, most major league teams offer  salaries and contracts that are largely based on these metrics. However these metrics are often relics of a pre-modern view of the game. Statisical analysis had proven that on-base percentage and slugging percentage are better indicators of offensive success and with newer metrics like Wins Above Replacement and Fielding Independent Pitching, teams can get a better indication of how much a player is truly worth to a team.
